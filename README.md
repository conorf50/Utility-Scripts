#### A collection of somewhat useful scripts that can speed up Node web development


noderefresh.sh - Removes /node_modules and runs npm-install in all subfolders of a directory
resetAll.sh - Runs 'git reset --hard in a subfolders of a directory

These scripts will warn you before doing anything but I am *not* responsible for any damage caused
